        <p>When I first entered the work force I was not a developer, I was a machinist. I started machining when I was in High School.
            When I first started I was in love with it, I still am to this day, but when I graduated and got my first job I quickly realized it was not for me.
            So after a year or so of machining I found my passion Emergancy Medicine. I loved all what I was learning in school.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always been passionate with computers. I started The coding bootcamp back in February of 2022, So I do not have many projects as of yet
